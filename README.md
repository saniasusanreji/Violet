we build SceneSpeaker🌻
SceneSpeaker is an AI-powered wearable or mobile assistant that helps visually impaired individuals understand their surroundings through natural, conversational speech. It identifies objects, people, and obstacles in real-time and describes them in a friendly, human-like tone. The system enhances safety, awareness, and confidence—making navigation feel less like a challenge and more like a guided experience with a companion.

we used gemini-flash for the humanized interaction and we could implement it successfully by giving the input from the webcam and we Built an we app for it.
